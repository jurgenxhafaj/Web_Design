# Web_Design
A timeline of designing a website for a business, starting from scratch; using HTML5 code, and then publishing tools (Wix, in my case).

Folder names are pretty self-explanatory.

Note: The business is completely fictional; the menu options were taken from Rome's (best) Ad-Hoc Ristorante, Peabody, MA's Gallo Nero, etc. Here are their respective websites: https://www.ristoranteadhoc.com/en/ ; http://www.galloneroristorante.com/ .
Also, for the purpose of making functional links, they lead to Gallo Nero's social media, etc.

P.S. I have been to Gallo Nero several times and would very happily recommend it to anybody.

This class was led by Dr. Leah Schultz, Tarleton State University.
