NOTE:

I tried really hard to link the website to the custom 404 page but I failed. Sorry!
I will, however, find a way to understand the instructions online about it.
Included is a .htaccess file, it was neccessary according to their instructions.
Also, I still need to fix the navigation bar to display properly, as well as improve the log-in/sign-up bar.
This is a work-in progress, so it has some stuff and documents that I'm experimenting with.
